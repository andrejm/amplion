      The legends, Suchý & Molavcová, accompanied by a part of the Big Band Semafor will come to Banská Štiavnica for the 5th birthday of the Amplifier Festival!

The duo of stars invites you to a spontaneous and relaxed party where neither age, nor time matter. What matters is who comes up with the better Czech music hit from the last 100 years. Comedians freely improvise, sing, joke around and make suggestions that will surprise even the Big Band itself. However, they will not get confused and will excellently play to the satisfaction of the duo, and perhaps also take requests from the viewers for famous hits and crowd-pleasers. Every evening is different and unique. And as is common at every celebration, a surprise is also planned! So grab your place at the cabaret table while it is still available...

  perex: Performative concert and the nonsensical lecture of the laureate of the Oskár Čepan award 2019 Erik Sikora
  content: 
    -
     What will you experience? A musically simplistic, even naive, DIY garage or bathroom songs played on an acoustic guitar or bass, gently seasoned with finger-snapping, home or forest noises, and naive piano mini-solos. The lyrics are a product of an excited observation of the world and its bizarre details. They play on words, experiment with the Eastern-Slovak language rhythm and are sung in a way that borders on spoken word. Džumelec presents his artistic production in a seemingly informal way in order to activate political topics that lead to the basic and unavoidable questions on who we are right now.
    -
     '<em>Erik Sikora translates questions about national identity, ecology or sustainability via performative strategies. His performances often take the form of a lecture or a live concert outside of the gallery space. In other cases, he communicates via pre-recorded videos on the verge of nonsense and poetic symbolism. He is interested in banality and its imaginative potential. He likes when people have direct free access to his performances. He presents his theories, ideas and observations which usually reach their conclusion in the form of a manual, such as in Tešenie or Dážďovník. In his art, he strips the imagination of conventional habits and rules, enables authentic being and can potentially set off the proverbial social bomb.</em>'

  content: 
    -
     Here it is, we keep our promises! After one year, the short sketch of the students of the theatre ensemble Lano which won last year’s SKETCH UP competition has turned into a full-length cabaret. As the first ones in Slovakia, you will be able to see the fresh Slovak cabaret performance with elements of new circus, based on themes of the book by the Romanian author, Aglaja Veteranyi, WHY THE CHILD BOILS IN PORRIDGE. The horror name about the boiled child is aimed to distract the main character from an even bigger horror  ̶  the one that has her mother, an artist, hang from the ceiling of the circus tent by her hair, juggling, every day. A seemingly naive child narrative from the world of nomadic circus performers will pull you into a magical story about the worth of human life. And by the way, is there a circus in heaven?
    -
     '<em>The Theatre ensemble Lano was founded in 1986 as part of the literary-dramatic specialisation at the Art School J.Kresánka in Bratislava. The founder, director and leading artistic persona of the group was Alexandra Skořepová. During its 30 years of existence, the theatre has been regularly taking part in the most prestigious theatre competitions in Slovakia and has won the award of the Slovak Ministry of Culture for the Creative Effort of The Year, awarded at Scenic Harvest, twice. The ensemble also took part in international festivals in Lingen, Paderborn, St.  Pőlten and Bressanon.</em>'

     A contemporary, sarcastic story based on the motifs of a novel of the same name written by  Siergiusz Piasecki brings a testimony of human roughness, stupidity and crooked character. It is also a brilliant acting display of what power and primitivity can do to a person.

A huge dose of humour, even if it’s bittersweet!

     Humorous and brave street theatre with a love story! A man, thrown out of his home, wanders the streets looking for a new meaning of life. What if it is Banská Štiavnica, a forgotten balcony of the Old Castle, that holds his new love? Let us go flying together! Come and witness if he has love at an arm’s length or is too far gone. The street acrobatic show about courting one’s love is a daring flying exploit in the form of vertical dance on the walls of ancient buildings. Italian romance underneath the balcony is interwoven with irony, sarcasm and, of course, fun. The climax of the play is the original song of Italian bel canto from the 30s and a breathtaking finale that stops everything and lets it float in mid-air. Because… love is in the air! The flying fantasy is a homage to Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, the masters of silent movie slapstick and thanks to Amplifier, you will see it in a Slovak premiere! Fly away and dream to the maximum  ̶  a recipe not only for lovers!

     'There are people who complain about everything around them. In this case, they complain via speech bubbles that eventually “eat” them. Do you want to help them get out of their bubble? All you need to do is to send an impulse via sound  ̶  applause, which will be captured by microphones. These impulses, registered on the mapped wall of a building, will set these grumblers from their narrow bubbles. And maybe even we live in such a bubble of our own. So have at it, this game is for anyone who wants to get rid of these bubbles! With our loud applause, we will break all bubbles, not just the virtual ones on the wall, but also the ones within. Because a good applause is certainly freeing. The more of us there will be, the freer, more bubble-deficient, real and authentically beautiful the world will be.'

    Five young interprets and their authentic testimonies of texts from both foreign and Slovak prose and poetry. Do you want to know what a spoiled and arrogant child can cause? Are you curious about a tragicomedic story about a life-long love, unfulfilled only due to sheer pettiness? Do you know how far one has to fall in order to rise again or that if we live with someone close to you, they might actually be incredibly distant? Oh, and do women become men in times of war? All of those questions will be answered in the specially composed evening of intense literary quality that is sure to lead you out of any prejudice about conventional reciting. After all, thoughts are the currency of the 21st century!

  content:    
   -
    Enter a world of free-spirited playful songs with your children! Džumelec, the laureate of the Oskár Čepan Prize for 2019 and a young father of 4 will be the one singing and playing for you. The main motif of his art is the promotion of the letter DŽ and how necessary its juiciness is. You can look forward to musically simplistic, naive,even, songs that were made DIY in the garage or bathroom, played only with an acoustic guitar or bass guitar, seasoned with finger-snapping, home or forest noises, as well as naive keyboard solos. The lyrics provide excited observations of the world and its bizarre details. They play with the world, play with words, experiment with Eastern-Slovak language rhythm and are sung in a way that borders on spoken word. Great intelligent fun!

    'Family theatre about something we all know. It is simply about farts, little and big ones. The main motto is: “One who farts, feels better.” The audience will experience the unexperienced and see the unseen. The decontaminator, flatulator, the mammoth… all of that in one package. The small ones will enjoy the fun interaction and will learn that farting is human. The big ones will lose their fear and shame. But be warned! “One who is afraid should not visit the circus. Because in the circus, all you will hear is the truth: The small ones, the big ones, the dead ones, everyone farted. And if they didn’t, they burst.” This show about a taboo topic is intensely charming. You will be bursting  ̶  with laughter!'
