      'Stop by and experience a unique dance/physical theater. Wonderful live music, captivating visuals and unique performances of 15 dance artists for everyone between 5 and 105 years of age. The world of adults sometimes seems like a huge factory where everyone is after something, they follow norms, fill quotas, make tremendous effort to get unimportant things and have no time to live. You have surely met the self-proclaimed kings, stressed businessmen or self-centered vain types. Those have pushed their little prince to the farthest place of their soul and covered him with false values. And all of us who have managed to not become adults yet, thanks to him, have the important task to make this world a better and happier place. Stop by and revive the Little prince in you, too.

      'Accept the invitation to Olympus! Sit down comfortably, enjoy some bubbles and our bar posse will take care of you. Can a person dare to do everything? Is a person the master of life and death? Are we God-like? A bar cabaret noir about those who feel like they are more than god, but also those who are truly like him. What prevails? Humility or being god-like? The threats the pandemic brought and the horrors of war that the developed world accepted in actual horror movies or in third world countries, have lived like gods. This unique time has shown that the topic of godliness (in its multiple meanings) is absolutely contemporary. The cabaret play based on examples from current society maps situations and motifs of human godliness. “The godlike” as untouchable rulers of life and death, and, on the contrary “the godlike” as compassionate with everyone without difference, so truly similar to God. The cabaret show is suitable for all viewers over 15 years of age.'

  content:

      'Do artists depend on their audience? Of course, there is no theater without an audience. However… can they be dependent on the audience also physically? That is the challenge of the French performer Miguel Rubio! His performance with a Chinese pole literally rises and falls in cooperation with the audience. Eight audience members will split along the scene and use their body weight while sitting in chairs to support Miguel in the air on an 8-meter artistic pole during the whole show. Those who decide to provide their help will feel that Miguel’s life and show truly depend upon them. Playground is a <b>touching story about human trust and cooperation that makes all of us grow</b>. It hides numerous surprises and unexpected situations and, in addition, brings a unique mix of disciplines, such as the Chinese pole, circus, dance, theater and of course, comedy. However, it all depends on you, the audience, whether it will be a feather-light comedy or a heavy-weight drama! Miguel Rubio created a unique model of circus-art play, which relies solely on the audience in order to fulfill his dream: present the Chinese pole anywhere. The result is a physical show that has the magical power to bring an exclusive experience to the hall of the Cultural center and to the garden of the Scout house in Banská Štiavnica.'

      'Miguel Rubio is a member of the circus artist group Collectif Primavez, which was formed in 2015 in Lille, France. They cooperate via creative research laboratories and put focus on themes such as immigration, women’s social position, equality and the growth of consumerism and use comedy, irony, and poetry. Thanks to circus, dance and theater, they bring many memorable experiences to viewers all around the world.'

  content: 
    - 'The band plays their own, almost acoustic music with little electricity used, which makes them one of the artists with the lowest carbon footprint and the most intense relation to the environment, alongside didgeridoo players and Gregorian chant singers. The band was created in 1979 in Bratislava by (as virtually every band until today) Eastern Slovaks. After three years of a successful career and successful college graduation of members, the band disappeared and it seemed like there would finally be a calm. In 2019, on the band’s 40th anniversary, the protagonists dusted off the original repertoire and found songs made of lasting material, so they decided to perform live again. Despite huge success, the band remains humbly unknown. The Covid wave in 2020-2021 swept the band into the rehearsal room, where the repertoire grew to yet-unseen sizes. And since the rehearsal room can barely contain it, the band started dragging the material all around Slovakia. Now, it is bound for Banská Štiavnica.'
    - '<em>The repertoire of PUKA is created by the tandem of authors Jakubov / Baláž. For their musical style, they came up with the tag “sub-Carpathian blues” to show that they are trying to smuggle the atmosphere of songs by blind African-Americans from New Orleans, as well as the melodic and harmonic nature of the regions of the eastern part of the Carpathian arc. </em>'

However, we did not know how sad and contemporary the theme would become on February 24th, 2022. Karol Sudor, the creator of great interviews with significant personalities, will discuss with our two esteemed guests who will provide their personal stories about the events in Ukraine. Our invitation was accepted by the renowned Czech humanitarian worker and decorated reporter <b>Petra Procházková</b>, who has been mapping Ukraine and Russia for decades, from the Czech Deník N, and <b>Viera Dubačová</b>, the Slovak activist and director whose personal quest is to help the weak and vulnerable, which means she does not hesitate to regularly visit our neighbors in the east to help. The interview and an informal dispute will be extended by an exhibition of international caricatures with Ukrainian representation, ANTI-HYBRID.'
    - '<em>Karol Sudor worked in Volkswagen Slovakia and PSA Peugeot Citroën in the health and safety department, and later as the manager of the HR department. He worked in the daily SME, and is in Denník N today. He has been nominated for the Journalist award 10 times and won 5 times in the Best interview category. He published a book of interviews with Fedor Gál (One last time - the end of the story), as well as a book of interviews with Vladimír Palko (I went to the edge  ̶  a liberal makes a conservative confess). He provided temporary housing to Ukrainian families himself.</em>'

  perex: Non-sermon of Daniel Pastirčák about why it is good to slow down and stop by for art
  content: 
    - 'The topic of this year, “to stop” came from a need to slow ourselves down in an overly economized everyday life and in an unhealthy rush, aiming to focus our attention to unique values that we overlook in the daily grind, or take for granted. Such as nature, beauty, and art. However, how to slow down, stop, bask and not miss anything? That will be the topic of dispute, with Karol Sudor, creator of renowned interviews with famous people, and the Slovak writer, philosopher and ecumenical preacher of the Church of the Brethren, <b>Daniel Pastirčák</b>. The “Slovak Tomáš Halík”, a person who connects christians of all denominations with agnostics and atheists, will read and tell stories from his works.'

  content:
    - 'Young interprets and their authentic performances of texts of international and Slovak poetry and prose, this time enriched with the visual and aural performance of Naďa Salbotová’s exhibition, Time-Minds. We will travel through a magical environment of the unexplored ossuary of the Old castle, which will echo with a careful selection of strong authentic testimonials about slowing down and stopping, with humor and without it. We will slow down wondering about time and the end of the world, we will dip into the fresh waters of nonsense, where everything and nothing gives purpose and joy, we will hear a discussion with a rock about human toughness and an allusion to the parallel stories of Jews and current stories of our neighbors in the East. These will be some of the topics of the changing, and specially composed evening of high-quality literature that will shatter your prejudice about conventional recitals. Thanks to the connection of spoken word and live visual interaction, you will experience a marvel for eyes and the soul. Do not hesitate, this will be a one-off event!'

    - "The author introduces the exhibition with the words: “My first solo exhibition was focused on painting. Dreamt of. I have been buying canvases for years, they have stood, leaning against some corner of the attic. This year, the TIME was ripe and I started working. It is a challenge for myself. It is not easy to dive inside… I turn into a misanthrope and I do not want to be disturbed. It is a quiet meeting between myself and I. A dive into my MIND, forgetting about TIME… I search for a motive that would lift the spirits and establish balance… hours pass and I don’t know how. It seems like a dream, a day in a minute and a minute in a day. Balancing between the desire for perfecting, realizing my limits, and the euphoria of what is successful. I admire human faces, and have painted dozens of portraits of people of all ages… the love for human faces never went away. My paintings also arise from portraits of people, fictional ones, and I add various atmospheres to them - dreamscapes, symbols, abstract color structures. Those are my worlds of MINDS placed in dimensions without time - my TIME-MINDS.”"

  perex: Diagnostics of society via drawn humor

  content:
    - '<em>„We cannot defeat human stupidity. But we cannot ever stop fighting it.“</em> Jan Werich.
      <b>Vernissage and guided tour of the international exhibition of world-renowned cartoonists </b>
      as a slow-down from lies, misinformation and conspiracies. The Anti-Hybrid exhibition 
      reveals information manipulation and totalitarian dictators, and provides defense and 
      catharsis via laughter. It is the answer to the deceit of false communication which decimates 
      people, creating a feeling of threat and fear, supports hatred, aggression, creates conditions 
      for chaos, uncertainty and doubts trust in authorities responsible for governing society and moral values.'
    - 'The quote by the nazi ideologist Joseph Goebbels, “A lie repeated a hundred times becomes the truth,” is the central idea of manipulation, which is, sadly, true also for the current state of affairs. The pressure of misinformation and propaganda on various target groups via fake news grows.  The number of conspiracy websites and so-called alternative media, aimed at spreading intolerance, aggression, distrust, doubt, xenophobia and such is rising. Illuminati, bankers, Big Pharma, the army, the secret service and Baba Vanga. Searching for the unfindable in the spaces of one’s own illusion, virtual identity and emotional bluffing. This, too, is reflected at the international exhibition of humor drawn by world-renowned cartoonists, diagnosing the causes and effects of the info-war, sarcastically reacting to stumbling in the communication fog and searching for objective truth. On Friday, at 15:00, we will welcome you at the vernissage of the exhibition and a guided tour with special guests in attendance. On Saturday at 12:30, you can enjoy the exhibition with the addition of sketches by Palo Seriš. Pick your time for laughing in the face of stupidity!'

Humorous situations full of situational gags will guide you through a dynamic story starting with being recklessly stunned by a new visionary, through an unexpected threat, all the way to sobering up from a flock attitude thanks to using your wits. Caution, the prevalence of (un)common human stupidity and its irrational symptoms can have tragic consequences! Is there anybody who can save us from the savior? Caution, stupidity can kill!'
