professors and wives, and finally by their own children). They still go on to this very day, to the
delight of their more intellectual audience. From their original &quot;radio&quot; dialogues and short stories,
they moved on to authorial theatre. They have written and performed several plays and cabarets,
a bunch of songs and countless sketches. It is fair to say this is, undoubtedly, an authentic and
original amateur theatre, with all the positive risks that go with it."
