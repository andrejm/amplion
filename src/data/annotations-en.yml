on which their absolute humour would not be limited (first by parents and teachers, later by
professors and wives, and finally by their own children). They still go on to this very day, to the
delight of their more intellectual audience. From their original &quot;radio&quot; dialogues and short stories,
they moved on to authorial theatre. They have written and performed several plays and cabarets,
a bunch of songs and countless sketches. It is fair to say this is, undoubtedly, an authentic and
original amateur theatre, with all the positive risks that go with it.</i>"

      "Let’s analyse the current social events with commentators and journalists Marián Leško, Martin
M. Šimečka and Matúš Kostolný. Moderated by Monika Tódová. Daily N (in)regularly organizes a
series of How to Save Democracy discussions all over Slovakia. &quot;There is a lot at stake in these
elections and we realise that it is not enough to just write about the situation. That&#39;s why we
decided to go around Slovakia and debate about it. It is one of the privileges of democracy and I
believe people do not want to lose it,&quot; says Matúš Kostolný, editor-in-chief of Daily N. The
creators of AMPLIFIER also care about the democratic development of our country, so you are all
welcome at the debate."

      "Which authors are more prone to lean to tragedy? Which ones want to dig as deep as possible
into the human soul until they find something dark there? And which of them bring sunshine and
wit to literature? Is it Russians or Ukrainians? And how does a gogolesque laughter through tears
come about? This will also be the topic of the discussion about the relationship between
Ukrainian and Russian culture in the time of war, about the attitudes of the people of other
countries towards Russian and Ukrainian literature and its present work. Patrik Garaj, Daily N&#39;s
culture reporter, will discuss the topic with our guest, Russian scholar and translator, Valerij
Kupka, and with you. The interview and informal discussion will be accompanied by reading from
the book by Ukrainian author Yuri Andrukhovych, translated into Slovak by Valerij Kupka."
