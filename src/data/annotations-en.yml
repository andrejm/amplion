After the performance, you'll experience an after-concert by the Filtr Band combined with the Krvik Totr band, who sing chords, play with words, and it fits you.

      "<i><b>Krvik Totr</b> was founded by Petr Jediný Novotný and Tomáš Kout in Prague in 1992 as a platform where their absolute humor wouldn't be restricted (first by parents and teachers, later by professors and wives, and finally by their own children). They continue this pastime to this day, for the joy of their more intellectual audience. From original 'radio' dialogues, they moved on to original stories and eventually to original theater. They have written and performed several plays and cabarets, a bunch of songs, and countless sketches. From this, it can be deduced that it is undoubtedly an amateur original theater with all the positive risks that come with it."
