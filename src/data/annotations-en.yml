  perex: Tragic and comical cabaret show about strength, friendship and love among miners
  content:
    - <strong>The performance is a part of the Identity Renovation – Banská Štiavnica, City of Culture 2019 project</strong>
    - Here comes a mining cabaret club, filled to the brim with uniquely Spanish-styled songs and dances. The dynamic and entertaining tragic comedy is truly a journey through movement, visual art and music, as well as pyrotechnical effects. It puts forth questions about whether it is a gift or a curse to be a miner and how much friendship is worth when you witness a tragic fate down below the earth. The grand experience on several micro-podiums is full of humour, touching moments and pays homage to all the unknown heroes who died doing this honest, but hard work.
    - The Basque theatre ensemble Markeliñe (*1987) creates theatre with a unique style. It creates original stories from the present which provide a critical view upon both the present and the past. It breaks old forms, explores and searches for new expressions of scenic language as well as uses of space. The viewers can contemplate their own personal conflicts and contradictions as they are painted with a sensitive, intelligent way on stage. The ensemble focuses heavily on free expression of emotions, on visual aspects and acting performances. They play and travel all around the world, from the East to the West.

  perex: A rebellious cabaret show of a famous punk tailored to Slovak reality
  content: 
    - Acting out all 39 of Shakespeare’s plays in 2 hours? The four members of the Reduced Shakespeare society can do it! They perform shortened version of the master’s tragedies, comedies as well as historical plays complete with references to contemporary pop-culture. their interpretation of Shakespeare’s works is non-conventional, rebellious, even. Othello’s story as a grand hip-hop concert? No problem, he was black after all. Thanks to the director Martin Čičvák, you will find a big piece of contemporary Slovak culture and the latest social developments in Shakespeare.

Their courage to experiment and enact non-traditional theatre forms in a traditional theatre, such as clown performances for children and adults, built their reputation as a unique place in the history of Slovak theatre. The current members are trying to follow up on this legacy of innovation and implementation of various theatre genres. The play The Entire Shakespeare, Swallowed In Under 120 Minutes comes from the play of three American actors who performed it on Broadway in New York and the West-End in London to immense success.

  perex: Mono-drama based on the motives of Umberto Eco’s novel “The Prague Cemetery”
  content: 
    - Funny, non-conventional and bold theatre! Do you want to know who is responsible for your streak of bad luck? Are you looking for the one responsible for all that is going on here? Come on in and you are guaranteed to pick someone. The original actor’s mono-drama by Peter Brajerčík based on Umberto Eco’s novel “The Prague Cemetery” explores conspiracy theories, anti-semitic and racist ideas springing from a difficult economic and social situation, as well as how they are reflected in the media and in politics. Eco, the historian, philosopher and aesthetician, plays with a refined explanation of history that uncovers the principles of political and purpose-built games. The play was awarded the Grand Prix at the New Drama 2019 festival.
    - The Prešov National Theatre is an independent professional theatre (est. 2013) in Prešov. Its leaders are the dramaturgist Michaela Zakuťanská and director Júlia Rázusová. The dilemma to either stay in Bratislava or to return to Prešov, one which is almost synonymous with the choice between working in the west or living in the east, led to a definite solution – moving to their hometown of Prešov and starting a theatre there. PNT adapt texts dealing with contemporary social, generational and sociological topics, touches upon the tension between the east and the west of Slovakia and comments on the differences in quality of life in the country. It also seeks to inspire people from different lines of work to come back to Prešov or to express themselves in smaller towns and outskirts.

      Songs and stories spoken from the piano will form this cycle of neutral memories of the times of November 1989. Such is the evening of the nonchalant singer-songwriter, cabaret performer and writer Jan Burian from Prague. It is suitable for the youth who was not yet alive back then, but also for the older generations, who can remember queueing for oranges, smuggling shirts from West Germany or the Iron Sundays. All of these memories will be balanced by songs from the cycle THE ECOLOGY OF THE SPIRIT on the topic of the contemporary life of people who are surrounded by media, stunned by supermarkets and SuperStars. You will learn what you can do in order to maintain your sanity and cultural position.

  content: 
    - Enjoy this Polish dose of musical energy and dance. Timingeriu is another unique music piece at the AMPLIFIER festival. They play a lively, highly danceable gypsy, Balkan and Jewish music. The band members often bring the accordion, the trumpet, the clarinet, percussions and an upright bass on bicycles. They also like to react to the momentary situation and mood of the audience, which they find underneath your window or in the local pub. The band travels and plays all around the world, often hitchhiking, cycling or just freely rowing, providing the people with unusual experiences using their music.     
    - The beginnings of the band come from a musical journey to Romania in 2009. The band is formed by multi-instrumentalists who are also members of the alternative music scene (Małe Instrumenty, Sutari), the jazz scene (Jazz Section at the Music Academy in Wroclaw) and the theatre scene (Gardzienice Theater, Song of the Goat theatre). Their debut album, Radio Rom, came out in 2015 and documented the concert of the band in Radio Ram in Wroclaw.

  perex: Concert of the work-music band of jokesters
  content: 
    - The band from Vrbové plays industrial folklore on non-serious, hand-made instruments and all of their songs are about work. The two blue-worksuit-clad members include the singer and “toilet-kickdrum” player Braňo Jobus and his “Mr. Brother” Andrej Budislav Jobus. He plays an array of bizarre, mostly wind instruments made exclusively out of plastic tubes, hoses, plastic bottles and an old vacuum cleaner. His collection also includes instruments such as the ACTHDFV (the Angry Carpathian Three-Headed Dragon from Vrbové), the six-meter Družba Pipeline, and the Fecal matter bagpipes. Their aphoristically humorous, minimalistically industrial songs, sung in the local Vrbové dialect, are representative of a one-of-a-kind musical style which celebrates work - the universal working man industrial folklore. It is typical to artistically recycle products and appliances for this style. The proof that VV are not just superficial jokers lies not just in their only seemingly banal lyrics, but also their goal to revive the need and the joy from (now already post-industrial) folk music. Their concerts burst with salvos of both real and musical laughter.
    - This musical group is named after the “V”, created by the leaning tower of the local church and a line constructed through the center of its perpendicularly constructed gate – VRBOVSKÍ VÍŤAZI (VV – VRBOVÉ WINNERS).

  perex: A unique walking street theatre about searching for the present-day treasure of Banská Štiavnica
  content: 
    - <strong>The performance is a part of the Identity Renovation – Banská Štiavnica, City of Culture 2019 project Programme for families</strong>
    - Enjoy this entertaining journey of the actors, the dog Cyril and the viewers behind the wagon of happiness. A journey after a yet-undiscovered treasure of the mining town, which does not only hide in silver, but also in the people and their personal stories. The inspiration behind the play is a mystery legend about the fate of the rich citizen Barbora Rösselová. The historical and contemporary form of the play will lead from the Radničné square via the St. Trinity square all the way to the Old Castle. Fourteen stops in unique exteriors will reanimate fragments of Štiavnica’s history right in front of the object where they took place. There will be acting, singing, dancing and tasting, but most importantly, laughing.
    - The Ensemble of Irregular Theatre is an independent group of friends of contemporary theatre which was formed by people of similar humanist thoughts and viewpoints. It was created after a generational and repertoire transformation of the Kremnica Theatre Underground (2012 - 2017). It searches for new forms of modern cabaret, as well as promotes street and socially engaged productions. It is based in Banská Štiavnica.

  content: 
    -
      A street happening of artists in the storefronts of shops, reflecting the revolution in 1989 and what came after. It is composed of 7 stops – model situations at the Trotuár and the audience trots between them accompanied by the music of Vrbovskí Víťazi. Multi-genre installations of cartoons by artists from all around the world (the mobile exhibition FREE BRAIN EVOLUTION) including two works which had their authors sentenced to death in their home countries (Arifur Rahman, Bangladesh and Fadi Abou Hassan, Syria); a virtual film memorial of 1989 from an old TV set, directed by Barbora Berezňáková as part of the cycle “Ask your folks”; original civically engaged songs by the activist Jakub Pohle and his band Režimy (Regimes), but also an art installation of an oversized, divided head by the performer Dušan Krnáč called REVOLUTION IN THE HEAD - desires vs. reality. There, you will be able to write down your (un)fulfilled desires from times before the revolution… but most importantly, the ones that came after.

  content: 
    - Do you know what Charta 77, the Candle manifest, the march of the students on November 16th 1989 were? Who were the main speakers on the stands and why is it called the Velvet revolution? If you do not know, don’t worry, the Les Mess Revolucioners quiz will make that right. With humor, playfulness and a critical eye, we will take a look at what this important event, whose 30th anniversary falls on this year, means for us. The quiz will feature photos, videos, news articles and questions about revolutionnaires from Banská Štiavnica. Teams are composed of 3 to 6 people. Do you have yours already?

  content: 
    - "Host and co-author of the film, Fedor Gál, says the following in the opening sequences: “You will see a film about a society that had come to the crossroads. One road leads to a chasm, one into the unknown. We don’t want to go to the chasm and we should step into the unknown educated. We should understand why we live in a society where people are demotivated, ignorant, and have a lack of belief towards those in power. We should know why institutions that should be taking care of our health and our children are failing. We should understand the pathology of everyday life, why corruption, carelessness and unrest are blooming before our own eyes. We should know all of that in order to take action and fix problems that bother us. Right here, right now, for the future’s sake.” You will see a movie that still rings true today. Directed by Iľja Ruppeldt, dramaturgy by Dežo Ursíny."

    - What were you dreaming of after the Iron Curtain fell? How many of your dreams have you fulfilled during those 30 years of freedom? Now, you can eternalize your desires and their state in reality. The artist and performed, Dušan Krnáč, closes the circle on his oversized head and gives you space to express yourself. The head, finally free of barbed wire, can think, compare and summarize. And what about our heads, are they truly free? Or is the barbed wire still somewhere inside? Let us know and leave us a message.
