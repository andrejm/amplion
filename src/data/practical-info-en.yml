    - <strong>Book your accommodation first and book well in advance</strong>. Štiavnica is a very popular tourist destination and it may happen that you will not be able to find any accommodation just a few days ahead of the festival. 
    - You can get the <strong>tickets</strong> starting August 1st, 2019 online at <a href="/vstupenky/">www.amplion.eu/vstupenky</a> (or at www.tootoot.sk) – these can be booked until the start of the production. You can also visit the Central ticket sales point (located in the Cultural centre, use the side entrance from Akademická street) personally as early as August 29th to get tickets.
    - <strong>Festival passes</strong> for AMPLIFIER are not possible to obtain.
    - The <strong>programmes start precisely as written in the schedule</strong>. So please, plan ahead and come on time, because it may happen that you will have to wait until you are allowed inside by the staff. And until then, you would surely get sad. :(
    - <strong>Sweaters and good, sturdy shoes</strong> are almost required for AMPLIFIER. The evenings do get colder and the terrain in the city is almost mountainous.

    - Do you want to make sure that you will get to your chosen production? <strong>Simply buy your tickets in advance – online at <a href="/vstupenky/">www.amplion.eu/vstupenky</a>. </strong> Some festival venues only have limited capacity and nobody wants to learn that the show is sold out just a few minutes before the fun starts! You can comfortably buy your tickets using your PC or mobile phone up to one minute before the production starts.
    - <strong>After the beginning of the programme, it is not possible to buy tickets anymore.</strong>
    - You can also buy tickets in person by visiting the Central ticket sales point. You can buy your tickets even after the production begins and the online sale has stopped. This sales point is located by the side entrance to the Cultural centre (from Akademická street), and is open on Thursday, 29th of August 2019 from 15:00 till 21:00, on Friday and Saturday from 9:00 till 23:00 and on Sunday from 9:00 till 18:00.
    - <strong>Don’t forget – tickets are not sold at the festival venues!</strong>

    - Sadly, <strong>we do not sell festival passes</strong> for AMPLIFIER. The venues have a different capacity and we would not be able to ensure that all the owners of festival passes would be able to attend all productions.

  chapter: 4
  id: how-to-get-here

    - <strong>By bus or train</strong>
    - Be prepared to walk from the final stop – the train station is approx. 3 km from the centre and the bus station approx. 2 km from the centre. Also, pack a book, because due to transfers, this kind of travelling might take a while. You can catch buses to Štiavnica from Žarnovica, Žiar nad Hronom, Zvolen or Levice. If you are travelling by train, transfer in Hronská Dúbrava. However, the train ride to Banská Štiavnica on the famous Štiavnická Anča train is spectacular and we definitely recommend this journey. If you are looking for more info on travelling with public transportation, click here. 
    - <strong>By car</strong>
    - You can get to Štiavnica from the R1 via several routes. Pick your route according to your driving skills. The easiest access is via the exit next to Hronská Dúbrava, passing through Kozelník and Banská Belá. The middle-of-the-road solution is picking the exit from R1 near Bzenica, passing through Vyhne and Hliník nad Hronom in the direction of Sklené Teplica. The third option, for those who enjoy deep-forest winding uphill drives, is to go via Žarnovica and Hodruša-Hámre.

  id: parking
  content: 
    - On your way to AMPLIFIER, please, <strong>use one of the main car parks</strong>. They are all very close to the city centre and will save your time and patience which you would certainly lose while navigating the narrow winding streets of Štiavnica. Cars don’t fit there, anyway. You cannot park in the St. Trinity square anymore, as it has become a pedestrian area on July 1st, 2019. You will find the main car parks on the Mládežnícka street (free of charge) and just below the New castle on the Novozámocká street (where you will be charged 0,50€ for an hour or 3,50€ for a day).

    - <strong>Festival visitors</strong>
    - Accommodation in Banská Štiavnica during the summer season is in extremely high demand and sells like hot cakes. We recommend booking your accommodation in a hotel, lodging house or a BnB at least 2 months ahead of time.
    - If you would like to stay in the very heart of the festival, we recommend our partner Hotel Grand Matej. There are, however, dozens of other options. You can choose, among other places, by following <a href="https://www.banskastiavnica.travel/ubytovanie" target="_blank">this link</a>.
    - <strong>Performers and festival guests</strong>
    - Are you heading to the festival as a performer or as a guest? A comfortable bed already awaits you, courtesy of our caring partners. We would like to thank them for their cooperation. We recommend the following means accommodation to festival viewers outside of the festival dates, because their owners are very forthcoming and helpful.

  chapter: 7

    - Directly in the city centre, you will find quite a few restaurants. However, please, remember that the city is packed with festival-goers and tourists during these dates, so the wait for your lunch or dinner may be longer than expected. Sometimes even 45 – 60 minutes. Plan ahead so that you don’t miss the beginning of your planned festival programme. 
    - The restaurants we have tried and tested are Black M, Monarchia, Tratória, Kachelman and Reštaurácia Matej, which is directly next to the festival club. If you want to buy your own groceries, there is a small shop directly in the city centre. A wider selection can be found in the Tesco and Lidl supermarkets in the Drieňová city part, or in Billa at Križovatka.

  content: 
    - The festival productions take place in 10 different interior and exterior venues in the city centre of Banská Štiavnica. <!--Please, have a look at the festival map to see all of the venues clearly marked.--> Usually, the productions take place between 10:00 in the morning and end around midnight. Please, plan carefully, because the productions start exactly according to schedule! If you are a few minutes late, you may have to wait for the organisers to let you in, or even worse, you may not be let in at all, because late arrivals bother both artists and audience members.

    - Every festival has its core, a place where the life never stops. The heart of AMPLIFIER is situated in our beloved <a href="https://artcafe.sk/" target="_blank">Art Cafe</a> in Akademická street nr. 2. It is a place to meet old friends and find new ones. A place for lively discussions over beer or wine, a place for laughter and for dancing. Several smaller productions will take place during the festival and every evening, there will be live music! Don’t miss the atmosphere in the renowned Art Cafe!

  title: Tips for visiting Štiavnica.
  chapter: 10
  id: few-more-tips
  content: 
    - Banská Štiavnica has a reputation of a town in the hills, surrounded by forests. This reputation is true. Especially at the end of summer, the evening temperatures may be too low for T-shirts. Do not forget to pack warmer clothes. You can also leave high heels at home. Your feet will thank you after walking in the winding streets and on the historical pavement.
    - Are you planning on visiting the festival with small children? Good, the young generation is welcome! If your child is used to a child carrier or baby carriage, we do recommend the carrier due to the slope of the streets.
    - If you need to travel around town fast (for example, from the city centre to the supermarket), you can use the local version of public transportation – cheap taxis. The ride from Križovatka to the city centre costs roughly 2 €.
