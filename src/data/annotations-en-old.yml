  content: 
    -
      "<em>„Come and laugh at everything you would be normally ashamed to laugh at, and ashamed at what you normally laugh at!“</em>  ̶  so goes the invitation of the renowned theatre and film professional, Jiří Havelka, who takes on social topics in surprising forms (such as the movie <em>Owners</em>”)."
    -
      "At the amphitheater, you will experience a new format  ̶  a stand-up play with a big dose of humor, a live band, amazing singers and dynamic fun of an unhinged evening! <b>Wanna stand up to racism? Wanna stand up? Let’s stand up then! </b> You say you have no prejudice? That you don’t see black and white? Go on this Czech-Roma expedition under your own grey brain matter! The carefully selected team of actors from the Goose on a String Theatre and authentic Roma personalities performs about the common Czech-Roma life. About the prejudice on both sides of the hyphen. About the (im)possibility of correcting them. Jokingly and seriously. It explores stereotypes and prejudice that are rooted in all of us, more or less. By the way, the stand-up genre was created from growing ethnic tension in the English and American society and has a long history of working with nationalism, racism and other social taboo. Suitable for viewers over <br> 15 years of age."
    -  
      "<em>The Goose on a String Theatre is a scene of contemporary topics and unexpected forms. Since 1967, it has been bringing together creators of multiple genres, for whom art is a lifelong stance. They build their productions on the freedom of speech, openness to dialogue and plurality of opinions, trying to cultivate the civic society in Central Europe. Thanks to its renowned and decorated personalities, such as Peter Scherhaufer and Eva Tálska in the past, or Petr Oslzlý, Vladimír Morávek and Anna Davidová today, it has a unique place on the European theatre map.</em>"

Two memorial stones that remind us of the murder of Regina Baroková and her son, Andrej Barok in the death camp of Sobibore (Poland) and two more in rememberance of MUDr. Rudolf Welward, the local doctor and his wife, Melánia. The guests of the podcast will be the children of the “disappeared neighbors” themselves and Ladislav Welward.'

The small plaques in the ground, the so-called stumbling blocks remind us of the fate of people who were persecuted, murdered, deported and banished during the times of nazism. They have been placed in over 25 European countries as the biggest decentralised memorial in the world.

They are materialized states of the inside of a human being during a gesture, in the active moment of creation. Crushed cans from beverages. They create a happening of art in the street full of anonymous people. They are the aesthetic of a personal and social situation. Compensation of problems with the consumption of energy drinks or alcoholic beverages. Depression, the word of the age, which has become the measure of the importance of one’s mental state and his unseen inner erosion. The concept is based on gathering ready-made objects and adjusting them into new visual artefacts right on the border between irony, the banality of waste and anxiety. The goal is to point at the consequences of the growing depression among the young generation. The performative exhibition engages the viewer, who will be forced to discover installed objects in the dark with a LED light. Just like one has to discover the symptoms of depression and the inner world.'
